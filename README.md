# Temporal Density and Galactic Curvature  
### A Speculative Alternative to Dark Matter

This repository contains the manuscript **"Temporal Density and Galactic Curvature: A Speculative Alternative to Dark Matter"**, a conceptual note proposing that variations in the local structure of time—generated by event density and dynamical activity—may contribute to galactic curvature in ways typically attributed to dark matter.

The work is not a full physical theory. It is a **cleanly articulated hypothesis** intended to open a conceptual space:  
- **Event density** generates *temporal tension*.  
- Temporal tension diffuses outward to form **temporal halos**.  
- Temporal halos slow time in the outskirts of galaxies.  
- Slower time deepens the effective gravitational potential.  
- The result can mimic dark matter phenomena such as flat rotation curves and lensing.

The manuscript outlines the hypothesis, a minimal conceptual model, qualitative observational signatures, and its relation to existing approaches in cosmology and modified gravity. It is written for clarity and testability rather than mathematical completeness.
